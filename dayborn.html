Many years have passed since the day my father and my mother first met. A normal day for my mother, 
she is wearing a dress, tied her hair into braid, and having some talk with her neighbors. She is 
all alone in their house that day, and most of the days because my father are outside, working to 
provide for his family. They have already one child, my elder sister but, she is in my grandmother’s 
care that time. My grandmother taken care of my elder sister until my mother give birth to me. Me 
and my sister is only a year and 8 months apart, and back to the story. My mother was busy talking 
with their neighbors not until her stomach starts to ache. She thought she was only having stomach 
ache from the food she ate earlier that day. She rushed to the comfort room and started to take a dump. 
But, there’s nothing coming out but the blood. She thought that she is only having a stomach ache  that 
time but in fact, I’m eager to get out that time, she will gave birth to me. She screamed loudly, and 
gladly, some of their neighbors heard her and brought her to clinic. Fortunately, she given birth to 
me at the nearest clinic and not at the bowl of our comfort room.<p>
