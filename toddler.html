Hi! My name is Ervin John S. Morante. Back in my toddler years, I remembered I was just a 
quiet kid before. I’m always at our house and I rarely go outside of our house to play with 
other kids. When I was a kid, I love basketball. My godfather always took me with him to go 
to a private court. My father and my godfather are teaching me how to play basketball. I also 
always watched them play basketball. I’m very close to that godfather of mine. He was the only 
godfather I have. I only have 1 godfather and 1 godmother. I’m very close to him and also to 
my father. We always go outside to play. We are poor and we have no money and my godfather have 
money. He always treat me and buys me toys. I miss my godfather. My toddler years are the times 
that we are always go out and see each other because after my toddler years, he and his family 
moved to other country and decided to live there.<p>
