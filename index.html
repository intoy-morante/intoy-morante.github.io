I'm a very honest person. I'm also kind, loyal, polite, obedient, caring, thoughtful, trustworthy,
understanding, sweet, punctual, shy, passionate, adventurous, creative, resourceful, generous, warm-hearted, 
hard-working, active, diligent, responsible, charismatic, handsome, easy-going, humble, and the most important 
thing, I lie sometimes.<p>

I'm a 20-year-old man. I'm an easy-going person who do not know what he wants to do in life. I just living my life each day 
forcing myself to survive. I tend to overthink many things all the times because that's how my mind works. For me to survive 
each day, I tend to listen to music in loud volume to calm my mind and prevent my mind to think of anything. I also like going 
to places that is quiet, have a fresh air, and the clouds are visible so that's where you can always find me.<p>

I hope you'll be back soon,<br>
Mr. Morante
