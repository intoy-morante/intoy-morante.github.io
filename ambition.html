Hello! I’m Ervin John S. Morante. I’m currently studying Bachelor of Information Technology with 
Specialization in Data Science at Universidad De Manila. Why I chose this course? Just because I 
have no other choice. I already have background in this course so, I decided that this is the path 
I will take. Actually, I have no ambition or dream. I only want to graduate college and find a 
stable job and give back the efforts of my parents. That’s all I want. Aside from that, there’s 
nothing more. I have no dream profession. I have no ambition to accomplish except for that. Instead, 
there are various fields I want to study. I want to study about philosophy, psychology, law, math, 
science, , computer, electronics, mechanical, and other more. Maybe, I just want to learn new things. 
I have no passion. I have no motivation. I’m an easygoing person. I’m a lazy person. I’m contended 
on what’s currently happening. I’m just doing what needs to be  done. I don’t exert any additional 
effort in doing things. Maybe there is something wrong with me. There are always many things running 
through my mind. I have a wild imagination. I’m also having difficulties understanding myself. I want 
to be changed. For now, I’m doing my best to overcome each day and that’s only what is important to me.<p>
